# Paper Title
Automatic consensus models to balance consensus cost, consistency level and consensus degree with attitudinal trust mechanism

# Paper Overview
These consensus models are implemented through optimization models, tailored to distinct primary objectives, resulting in outputs that encompass attitudinal parameters to realize the balance of consensus cost, consistency level and consensus degree.
